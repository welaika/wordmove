# Wordmove

Wordmove is a nice little gem that lets you automatically mirror local Wordpress installations and DB data back and forth from your local development machine to the remote staging server.

Think of it like Capistrano for Wordpress, complete with push/pull capabilities.

## Installation

That's easy:

```
gem install wordmove
```

## Usage

```
> wordmove help
Tasks:
  wordmove help [TASK]  # Describe available tasks or one specific task
  wordmove init         # Generates a brand new Movefile
  wordmove pull         # Pulls WP data from remote host to the local machine
  wordmove push         # Pushes WP data from local machine to remote host
```

## Movefile

You can configure Wordmove creating a `Movefile`. That's just a YAML file with all the local and remote host infos:

```yaml
local:
  vhost: "http://vhost.local"
  wordpress_path: "~/dev/sites/your_site"
  database:
    name: "database_name"
    username: "username"
    password: "password"
    host: "host"
remote:
  vhost: "http://remote.com"
  wordpress_path: "/var/www/your_site"
  exclude:
    - .git
    - .DS_Store
    - .sass-cache
    - Movefile
  database:
    name: "database_name"
    username: "username"
    password: "password"
    host: "host"
  ssh:
    username: "username"
    password: "password" # optional, will use SSH public key if available
    host: "host"
    port: 2202 # optional
```

## Known problems and limitations
* Wordmove requires an SSH connection to the remote host;
* Wordmove requires `mysqldump` and `mysql` to be present in the remote host and executable by the SSH user;
* Wordmove requires `rsync` to be present and executable in your machine;
